# Comparison-of-Neural-Networks-and-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-
During the progress of this project I found the main differences of Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network, everything is explained in the attached pdf.

I will attach the dataset used for this project, because the hog features that could be used for 2 Dimensional projects might be useful since extracting the them from the CIFAR-100 dataset took 8 hours.

I will include the saved models depending on the accuracy so you can use them or modify them as this was only a test to get better results.
